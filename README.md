# Learning TypeScript Projects

> Hands-on real world projects that will help you exercise your knowledge of TypeScript.

Welcome to the repository housing all of the projects for _Learning TypeScript_!
I'm excited you're here -- whether you're just browsing, or using the projects to practice as you read the book.

## Setup

First, clone the repository to your local computer, then run `npm install` to install required packages.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/projects learning-typescript-projects
cd learning-typescript-projects
npm install
```

Assuming that all succeeded, you're now ready to work on any and all projects! 🚀

### Starting on Projects

<!-- TODO: switch to the first project they'd ever need to work on -->

Projects are located under the name of their chapter, such as `arrays/analyzing-dna`.
Each has their own README.md with instructions on the commands to run from within that directory.

> Don't forget to `cd` into a project's directory before running its commands!

### Types of Projects

Each project follows a chapter in the Learning TypeScript book and aligns to one of the following three categories:

- 🥗 Appetizers: bite-sized directed warmups: set of independent mini-projects
- 🍲 Entrees: larger, more hands-off challenge: a single self-contained project
- 🍰 Desserts: the same structure as entrees, with a fun thematic twist
