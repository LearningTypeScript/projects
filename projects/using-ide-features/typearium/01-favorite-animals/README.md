# Step 1: Favorite Animals

We keep track of our visitors' favorite animals by a combination of informal polling and park ticket data.
The program we use to work with that data stores that list of favorites as an array of strings... duplicated in multiple places.
We have to modify all those places whenever the list needs updating.

Could you please use your IDE to extract the array into a shared constant, and re-use that constant?
