# Syntax Extensions

_Learning TypeScript_'s **Syntax Extensions** chapter works with some of the JavaScript syntax extensions included in TypeScript:

- Declaring class parameter properties in class constructors
- Using decorators to augment classes and their fields
- Representing groups of values with enums
- Using namespaces to create groupings across files or in type definitions
- Type-only imports and exports
