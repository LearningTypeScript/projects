# Step 1: What's in a Namespace?

Long before modern modules and Webpack,

Namespaces were a bundling way to go.

Since imports and exports do give them flack,

Upon this code imports and exports bestow.

## Specification

Convert the code in `index.ts`, `poetry.ts`, and `rhymes.ts` from namespaces to ECMAScript modules.

## Files

- `index.ts`, `poetry.ts`, and `rhymes.ts`: Modify code here.
- `index.solution.ts`, `poetry.solution.ts`, and `rhymes.solution.ts`: Solution code.
