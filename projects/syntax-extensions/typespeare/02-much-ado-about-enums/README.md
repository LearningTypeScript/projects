# Step 2: Much Ado About Enums

Objects and enums seem akin at first,

but on second glance they are not the same.

The objects option I find is the worst.

Please switch to enum of similar name.

## Specification

Convert the code in `index.ts` and `colors.ts` from namespaces to ECMAScript modules.

## Files

- `index.ts` and `colors.ts`: Modify code here.
- `index.test.ts` and `colors.test.ts`: Tests verifying your enum
- `index.solution.ts` and `colors.solution.ts`: Solution code
