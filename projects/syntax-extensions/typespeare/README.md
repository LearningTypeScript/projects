Salute, dear reader, thou TypeScript guru!
In these texts your syntax lesson contained.
Press thee inward for your lesson further,
That your latest TypeScript knowledge be strained.

## Setup

In one terminal, start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:

```shell
tsc --watch
```

In another terminal, run Jest on whichever step you're working on.
For example, to run tests for the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm test -- 1 --watch
```

## Steps

- [1. What's in a Namespace?](./01-whats-in-a-namespace)
- [2. Much Ado About Enums](./02-much-ado-about-enums)
- [3. Typus Andronicus](./03-typus-andronicus)

## Notes

- Don't import code from one step into another.
