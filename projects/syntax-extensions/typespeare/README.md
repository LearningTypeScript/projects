Salute, dear reader, thou TypeScript guru!

In these texts your syntax lesson contained.

Press thee inward for your lesson further,

That your latest TypeScript knowledge be strained.

## Setup

In one terminal, run the TypeScript compiler via the `tsc` script within whichever step you're working on.
For example, to start the TypeScript compiler on the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm run tsc -- --project 01-whats-in-a-namespace --watch
```

In another terminal, run Jest via the `test` script on whichever step you're working on.
For example, to start tests for the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm run test -- 1 --watch
```

## Steps

- [1. What's in a Namespace?](./01-whats-in-a-namespace)
- [2. Much Ado About Enums](./02-much-ado-about-enums)
- [3. Typus Andronicus](./03-typus-andronicus)

## Notes

- Don't import code from one step into another.
