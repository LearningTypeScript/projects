# Step 2: Unexpected Methods

Well folks, it seems like we've made an unexpected stop... somewhere.
We're not sure where.
Will the TypeScript enthusiast we spoke to earlier please to the front of the plane again?

Thanks for volunteering a second time.
We've found this odd script, `./index.ts`, that seems to make use of Array and String methods not present in our JavaScript environment.
Could you please help us fill in TypeScript types for them?

## Files

- `index.ts`: Add your types here
- `solution.ts`: Solution code

## Notes

- Don't change any runtime behavior. Just add types.
