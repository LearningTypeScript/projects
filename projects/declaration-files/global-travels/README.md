Hello, and welcome!
¡Bienvenidos!
いらっしゃいませ！
ברוך הבא!

We are so glad you're elected to travel with Type Air.
We hope your trip through the type-safe skies is peasant.
By the way, if there a software developer flying with us, please report to the front of the plane.
We have some files we'd like your assistance with.

## Setup

In your terminal, run the TypeScript compiler via the `tsc` script within whichever step you're working on.
For example, to start the TypeScript compiler on the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm run tsc -- --project 01-passport-declarations --watch
```

## Steps

- [1. Passport Declarations](./01-passport-declarations)
- [2. Unexpected Methods](./02-unexpected-methods)

## Notes

- Don't import code from one step into another.
