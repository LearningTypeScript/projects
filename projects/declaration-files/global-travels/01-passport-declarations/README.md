# Step 1: Passport Declarations

Hello, and welcome!
¡Bienvenidos!
いらっしゃいませ！
ברוך הבא!

We are so glad you're elected to travel with Type Air.
We hope your trip through the type-safe skies is peasant.
By the way, if there a software developer flying with us, please report to the front of the plane.

Ah, thank you for volunteering.
Since you're on an international flight, we will need to validate your passport before you can leave the designated travel area.
But: our systems are quite legacy and we've lost the type annotations for our passport checking system.

Could you please add in the missing global declarations so our `checkPassport` function can pass type-checking please?
It runs fine as-is -no need to change its runtime behavior- but we would all feel better with no TypeScript compiler complaints.

## Files

- `index.ts`: Add your types here
- `solution.ts`: Solution code

## Notes

- Don't change any runtime behavior. Just add types.
