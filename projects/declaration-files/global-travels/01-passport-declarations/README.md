# Step 1: Passport Declarations

Ah, thank you for volunteering.
Since you're on an international flight, we will need to validate your passport before you can leave the designated travel area.
But our systems are quite legacy and we've lost the type annotations for our passport checking system.

Could you please add in the missing global declarations so our `checkPassport` function can pass type-checking?
It runs fine as-is -no need to change its runtime behavior- but we would all feel better with no TypeScript compiler complaints.

## Files

- `index.ts`: Add your types here
- `solution.ts`: Solution code

## Notes

- Don't change any runtime behavior. Just add types.
