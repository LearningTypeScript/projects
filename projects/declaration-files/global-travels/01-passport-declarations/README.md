# Step 1: Passport Declarations

Ah, thank you for volunteering.
Since you're on an international flight, we will need to validate your passport before you can leave the designated travel area.
But: our systems are quite legacy and we've lost the type annotations for our passport checking system.

Could you please add in the missing global declarations so our `checkPassport` function can pass type-checking please?
It runs fine as-is -no need to change its runtime behavior- but we would all feel better with no TypeScript compiler complaints.

## Files

- `index.ts`: Add your types here
- `solution.ts`: Solution code

## Notes

- Don't change any runtime behavior. Just add types.
