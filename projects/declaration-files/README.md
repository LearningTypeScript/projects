# Declaration Files

_Learning TypeScript_'s **Declaration Files** chapter describes how to use declaration files and value declarations to inform TypeScript about modules and values not declared in your source code:

- Creating declaration files with _.d.ts_
- Declaring types and values with the `declare` keyword
- Changing global types using global values, global interface merges, and global augmentations
- Configuring and using TypeScript's built-in target, library, and DOM declarations
- Declaring types of modules, including wildcard modules
- How TypeScript picks up types from packages
- Using DefinitelyTyped to acquire types for packages that don't include their own
