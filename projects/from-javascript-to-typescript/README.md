# From JavaScript to TypeScript

_Learning TypeScript_'s **From JavaScript to TypeScript** chapter covers the context for some of JavaScript's main weaknesses, where TypeScript comes into play, and how to get started with TypeScript:

- A brief history of JavaScript
- JavaScript's pitfalls: costly freedom, loose documentation, and weaker developer tooling
- What TypeScript is: a programming language, a type checker, a compiler, and a language service
- TypeScript's advantages: freedom through restriction, precise documentation, and stronger developer tooling
- Getting started writing TypeScript code on the TypeScript Playground and locally on your computer
- What TypeScript is not: a remedy for bad code, extensions to JavaScript (mostly), slower than JavaScript, or finished evolving
