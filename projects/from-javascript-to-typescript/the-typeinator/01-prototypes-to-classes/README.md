# Step 1: Prototypes to Classes

The first project for you to overhaul hails from before the time of `class` syntax.
How primitive.

The [`original.js`](./original.js) file contains the project's original code for `Robot` and `Humanoid` functions used as classes.
Your job is to port that code to proper ES2015+ `class` classes.

## Specification

In `index.js`, export two classes using ES2015 `class` syntax:

- `Robot`, based on the `Robot` function in `original.js`
- `Humanoid`, extending the `Robot` class, based on the `Humanoid` function in `original.js`

## Files

- `index.js`: Write your `Robot` and `Humanoid` function here
- `index.test.js`: Tests verifying `Robot` and `Humanoid`
- `solution.js`: Solution code
