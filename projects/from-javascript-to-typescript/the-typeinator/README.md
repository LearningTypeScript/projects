# The Typeinator

> A [Learning TypeScript > From JavaScript to TypeScript](https://learning-typescript.com/from-javascript-to-typescript) ðŸ¥— appetizer project.
> You'll practice converting legacy JavaScript code to use newer ECMAScript syntax features.

_Zap!_
_Hiss..._
_Bang!_

A bolt of lightning strikes through the cloudless night.
Whisks of smoke swirl around your feet, stepping out of the time travel orb onto the streets of Los Angeles.
The year is 2004 and your mission is to prepare several JavaScript projects for the future of ECMAScript syntax features.

You are the _Typeinator_. ðŸ¤–

## Setup

In one terminal, run the TypeScript compiler via the `tsc` script within whichever step you're working on.
For example, to start the TypeScript compiler on the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm run tsc -- --project 01-prototypes-to-classes --watch
```

In another terminal, run Jest via the `test` script on whichever step you're working on.
For example, to start tests for the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm run test -- 1 --watch
```

## Steps

- [1. Prototypes to Classes](./01-prototypes-to-classes)
- [2. Callbacks to Async Await](./02-callbacks-to-async-await)

## Notes

- Don't import code from one step into another.
