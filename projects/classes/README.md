# Classes

_Learning TypeScript_'s **Classes** chapter introduces a plethora of type system features and syntaxes around classes:

- Declaring and using class methods and properties
- Marking properties `readonly` and/or optional
- Using class names as types in type annotations
- Implementing interfaces to enforce class instance shapes
- Extending classes, along with assignability and override rules for subclasses
- Marking classes and methods as abstract
- Adding type system modifiers to class fields
