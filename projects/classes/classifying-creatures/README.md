# Classifying Creatures

> A [Learning TypeScript > Classes](https://learning-typescript.com/classes) 🥗 appetizer project.

G'day, mate!
I'm here with the veterinarian center and a wonderful selection of great pets!
We've got a parrot, some gerbils and hamsters - and wow, a whole litter of puppies!
Crikey!

Thing is, we're just a tad bit overloaded with all the animals here.
We've got to get a system to categorize them.
Can you please help us classify our creatures?

## Setup

In one terminal, start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:

```shell
tsc --watch
```

In another terminal, run Jest on whichever step you're working on.
For example, to run tests for the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm test -- 1 --watch
```

## Steps

- [1. Polly Parrot's Properties](./01-polly-parrots-properties)
- [1. Dog Displays](./02-dog-displays)

## Notes

- Don't import code from one step into another.
