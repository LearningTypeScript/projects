# Step 3: Picking Pears

Well, narrow my types and call me a structurally matched type.
Aren't you just the most type-safe cowboy this side of the Sammamish River!

Our next and final request of you is to deal with a juicy one.
You're going to help us harvest some succulent cactus pears!
They make a mighty fine jam, if I do say so myself.

We can give you a whole array of potential cacti.
We'll need you to return back all the cacti with fruits.

## Specification

Export two functions:

- `isFruitBearingCactus`: a type predicate function named that takes in data of the provided `Cactus` interface and returns whether data is type `FruitBearingCactus`
- `pickFruitBearingCacti`: a function that takes an array of `Cactus` objects and returns an array consisting of all the `FruitBearingCactus` elements

## Files

- `index.ts`: Write your `isFruitBearingCactus` and `pickFruitBearingCacti` functions here
- `index.test.ts`: Tests verifying `isFruitBearingCactus` and `pickFruitBearingCacti`
- `solution.ts`: Solution code

## Notes

- The function's return type should be an explicit type predicate with the `is` keyword
