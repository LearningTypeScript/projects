# Step 1: Pruning Pests

Thanks for signing on to the farm, friend!
That's mighty kind of you.
We sure do appreciate it.

What we'll need from you first is help narrowing down the names of our fruits.
We know what we grow, but these darn type systems don't.
Can you help us out with a function to return whether a string is a known crop name?

## Specification

Export a type predicate function named `isCropName` that takes in a name of type `string`.
It should return whether the data is one of the keys of the type of the existing `cropFamilies` object.

## Files

- `index.ts`: Write your `isCropName` function here
- `index.test.ts`: Tests verifying `isCropName`
- `solution.ts`: Solution code

## Notes

- The function's return type should be an explicit type predicate with the `is` keyword
