Greetings, my fearless friend!
Using the power revealed to by Castle TypeScript, I have seen the plots of my evil nemesis, Skeletype!
Together we defend the universe and must stop those plots from becoming a reality!

We must gather our friends and gain understanding of our enemy.
These small projects will help us learn the lay of the land and gain the upper hand in the inevitable battle.
Please, join us!

For example, to run tests for the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm test -- 1 --watch
```
