> You'll practice using type modifiers to inform TypeScript's understanding of code.

Greetings, my fearless friend!
My companions and I are a group of powerful beings tasked with safeguarding the safety of this realm and many others.
Using the power revealed to by Castle TypeScript, we have seen the plots of my evil nemesis, Skeletype!
Together we defend the universe and must stop those plots from becoming a reality!

We must gather our friends and gain understanding of our enemy.
These small projects will help us learn the lay of the land and gain the upper hand in the inevitable battle.
Please, join us!

## Setup

In one terminal, run the TypeScript compiler via the `tsc` script within whichever step you're working on.
For example, to start the TypeScript compiler on the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm run tsc -- --project 01-fabulous-secret-powers --watch
```

In another terminal, run Jest via the `test` script on whichever step you're working on.
For example, to start tests for the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm run test -- 1 --watch
```

## Steps

## Notes
