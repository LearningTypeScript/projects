# Modifiers of the Types

> A [Learning TypeScript > Type Modifiers](https://learning-typescript.com/type-modifiers) ðŸ¥— appetizer project.

Greetings, my fearless friend!
My companions and I are a group of powerful beings tasked with safeguarding the safety of this realm and many others.
Using the power revealed to by Castle TypeScript, we have seen the plots of my evil nemesis, Skeletype!
Together we defend the universe and must stop those plots from becoming a reality!

We must gather our friends and gain understanding of our enemy.
These small projects will help us learn the lay of the land and gain the upper hand in the inevitable battle.
Please, join us!

npm test -- 1 --watch
```
