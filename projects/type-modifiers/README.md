# Type Modifiers

_Learning TypeScript_'s **Type Modifiers** chapter covers using type modifiers to take existing objects and/or types and turn them into new types:

- Top types: the highly permissive `any` and the highly restrictive `unknown`
- Type operators: using `keyof` to grab the keys of a type and/or `typeof` to grab the type of a value
- Using—and when not to use—type assertions to sneakily change the type of a value
- Narrowing types using `as const` assertions
