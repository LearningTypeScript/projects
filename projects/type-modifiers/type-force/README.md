# Type Force

Greetings, hero.
You have been carefully selected from a list of individuals who have demonstrated extraordinary powers in working with type systems.
Welcome to the ‚úñ Type Force ‚úñ.

Your powers in particular have manifested themselves in your ability to analyze situations for probable outcomes.
How wondrously useful.

We need you to develop a prediction engine that harnesses your abilities for good.
We've started what we can with a variable and a function, but sadly do not have type system expertise ourselves.
Your task is to create a `duel` function that takes in descriptions of two fighters as tuples, and returns a tuple describing the victor.
You'll also need to fill in type annotations in the existing code.

## Setup

In one terminal, run the TypeScript compiler via the `tsc` script.
For example, to start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:

```shell
npm run tsc -- --watch
```

In another terminal, run Jest via the `test` script.
For example, to start tests in watch mode:

```shell
npm run test -- --watch
```

## Specification

Create and export a `duel` function with two parameters, `good` and `bad`, both of which are objects containing the following properties:

- `mutations`: Array of strings that are keys in the `mutationsLibrary` object
- `name`: A string

Internally it will create a character for each variable.
A character object can be created with the following steps:

1. Initialize a `flying` property as `false`, and `power` and `toughness` as `1`
2. For each mutation in the power, run the corresponding function from `mutationsLibrary` on the character

The `duel` function's return type should be a read-only tuple containing two elements:

1. Either `"hero"` or `"villain"`, indicating who won, as computed by who has the higher of: their power divided by the other character's toughness
2. The winning character object

## Files

- `index.ts`: Add your types and `duel` function here
- `index.test.ts`: Tests verifying your types and `duel` function
- `solution.ts`: Solution code

## Notes

- The existing code has correct runtime behavior. You'll need to add type annotations to it, but don't delete any existing code.
