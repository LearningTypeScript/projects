# Step 3: Seating

You're doing wonderfully, my friend.
I can't wait to invite you to my next fancy dinner party.

Speaking of which, I need to properly type the program to randomize invitations and seat assignments.
My friends can be kind of childish -they're babies, really- and are very picky about seating.

I also very much like what you did with the string literal union types in the last step.
Could you please avoid using the `string` type altogether in this one?
Just use literal types.

Oh, and I think there's a typo in one of the names here too.
