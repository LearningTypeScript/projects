# Type Operations

_Learning TypeScript_'s **Type Operations** chapter unlocks the true power of TypeScript by operating on types in its type system:

- Using mapped types to transform existing types into new ones
- Introducing logic into type operations with conditional types
- Learning how `never` interacts with intersections, unions, conditional types, and mapped types
- Representing patterns of string types using template literal types
- Combining template literal types and mapped types to modify type keys
