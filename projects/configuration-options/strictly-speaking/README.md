# Strictly Speaking

Salutations.
I am Strictus Typus the Fourth, compiler of the Roman TypeScript armies.
My legions are spreading rapidly through the content, conquering as they go.

The masses long for inspiration.
Thus it is inspiration I must give them.

Yet, I am not a leader through speech.
I am a leader through action.
Of conquering soldiery.
Of brave deeds and noble intentions, spoken softly so as to not sharply jut out with overt obviousness.

Will you repair for me this speechwriter program?
I fear it was originally written without TypeScript's `--strictNullChecks` mode.
You must restore strict null safety -`undefined` and all- that it may run justly and without type errors.

## Setup

In a terminal, start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:

```shell
tsc --watch
```

## Files

- `index.ts`: Add type annotation shere
- `index.solution.ts` Solution code

## Notes

- Don't use `any` or leave any implicit `any`s.
- Don't change any runtime code behavior. You're just working in the type system.
