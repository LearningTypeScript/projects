# Configuration Options

_Learning TypeScript_'s **Configuration Options** chapter goes over many of the important configuration options provided by TypeScript:

- Using `tsc`, including its pretty and watch modes
- Using TSConfig files, including creating one with `tsc --init`
- Changing which files will be included by the TypeScript compiler
- Allowing JSX syntax in _.tsx_ files and/or JSON syntax in _.json_ files
- Changing the directory, ECMAScript version target, declaration file, and/or source map outputs with files
- Changing the built-in library types used in compilation
- Strict mode and useful strict flags such as `noImplicitAny` and `strictNullChecks`
- Supporting different module systems and changing module resolution
- Allowing including JavaScript files, and opting into type checking those files
- Using `extends` to share configuration options between files
- Using project references and build mode to orchestrate multi-TSConfig builds
