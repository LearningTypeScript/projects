_Psst!_
You!
Hey, you!
Are you who I think you are?
Are you the _messenger_?

If so, good.
Great.
Magnificent.
I have a series of secret messages I need you to encode.

We'll use TypeScript configuration options to do so.
Don't ask any questions - just go along with it.

## Setup

Start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:

```shell
tsc --watch
```

## Steps

- [1. Encoded Outputs](./01-encoded-outputs)
- [2. Allowed Imports](./02-allowed-imports)

## Notes

- Don't import code from one step into another.
