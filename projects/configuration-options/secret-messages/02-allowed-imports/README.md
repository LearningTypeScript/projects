# Step 2: Allowed Imports

Wow.
You really are as good as they say you are.
The job is only half done, though.
You've helped me encode my message -- but now I have some responses back that need to be decoded.

Can you apply your skills to this second TSConfig file so compiles without type errors?

## Files

- `answer.js`, `alternates.json`, and `index.ts`: Existing source code fie
- `tsconfig.json`: Set up your configuration options here
- `solution.test.ts`: Tests verifying your configuration options
- `tsconfig.solution.json`: Solution configuration options

## Notes

- Don't modify any source code. Only change `tsconfig.json`.
