# Arrays

_Learning TypeScript_'s **Arrays** chapter covers declaring arrays and retrieving their members:

- Declaring array types with `[]`
- Using parentheses to declare arrays of functions or union types
- How TypeScript understands array elements as the type of the array
- Working with `...` spreads and rests
- Declaring tuple types to represent fixed-size arrays
- Using type annotations or `as const` assertions to create tuples
