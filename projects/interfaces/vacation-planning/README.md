# Vacation Planning

> A [Learning TypeScript > Interfaces](https://learning-typescript.com/interfaces) ðŸ¥— appetizer project.

Welcome to beautiful upstate New York!
We're so excited you've chosen us for your vacation from the crowds and dirt of New York City.
Upstate New York features majestic mountains, quaint cottages, and wonderfully relaxing river walks.

Before you can enjoy your stay, however, there's one set of problems we need you to solve.
We haven't finished coding the applications to assist you in planning your stay.
Could you help us up-staters?

## Setup

In one terminal, start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:

```shell
tsc --watch
```

In another terminal, run Jest on whichever step you're working on.
For example, to run tests for the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm test -- 1 --watch
```

## Steps

- [1. Cities](./01-cities)
- [2. Restaurants](./02-restaurants)
- [3. Landmarks](./03-landmarks)

## Notes

- Don't import code from one step into another.
