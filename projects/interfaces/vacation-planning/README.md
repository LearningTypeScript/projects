Welcome to beautiful upstate New York!
We're so excited you've chosen us for your vacation from the crowds and dirt of New York City.
Upstate New York features majestic mountains, quaint cottages, and wonderfully relaxing river walks.

Before you can enjoy your stay, however, there's one set of problems we need you to solve.
We haven't finished coding the applications to assist you in planning your stay.
Could you help us up-staters?

## Setup

In one terminal, run the TypeScript compiler via the `tsc` script within whichever step you're working on.
For example, to start the TypeScript compiler on the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm run tsc -- --project 01-cities --watch
```

In another terminal, run Jest via the `test` script on whichever step you're working on.
For example, to start tests for the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm run test -- 1 --watch
```

## Steps

- [1. Cities](./01-cities)
- [2. Restaurants](./02-restaurants)
- [3. Landmarks](./03-landmarks)

## Notes

- Don't import code from one step into another.
