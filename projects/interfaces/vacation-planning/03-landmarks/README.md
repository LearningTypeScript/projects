# Step 3: Landmarks

Hooray!

We've included a `landmarks.json` file containing all the possible different landmarks we may ask to be described.

For this step, we'll need two things from you:

- A `Landmark` union type representing the possible landmark objects
- A `describeLandmark` function that takes in a `Landmark` object and returns a string describing it

Please make sure the `Landmark` union type plays well with TypeScript's type narrowing.
Its `type` property indicates which type of landmark it is.
We sure hope TypeScript has some kind of feature where a single property on an object can be checked to determine which member of a union type an object is...

For the `describeLandmark` function, its output should be a string containing two lines.
The first line will be in the format `<name> is a <type> in Upstate New York.`
The second line's contents will change based on what type of landmark it is:

- Forts: _(nothing: don't include a second line)_
- Lakes: `It covers <miles> square miles of water.`
- Lighthouses: `It was first lit in <lit> and is <feet> feet high.`
- Mountains: `Its peak is <height> feet high.`
- Parks: `It covers <acres> square acres.`
- Rivers: `It flows for <length> miles and is <deep> feet deep at its deepest.`
- Waterfalls: `It is <height> feet high.`

## Specification

Parameters:

1. `landmark`: An object describing a landmark

Return: A string describing the landmark

Example: Given the following object as input...

```js
{
  name: "Lake George",
  miles: 44,
  type: "lake"
}
```

...the function would output the following string:

```plaintext
Lake George is a lake in Upstate New York.
It covers 44 square miles of water.
```
