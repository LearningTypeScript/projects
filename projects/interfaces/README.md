# Interfaces

_Learning TypeScript_'s **Interfaces** chapter covers how object types may be described by interfaces:

- Using interfaces instead of type aliases to declare object types
- Various interface property types: optional, read-only, function, and method
- Using index signatures for catchall object properties
- Reusing interfaces using nested interfaces and `extends` inheritance
- How interfaces with the same name can merge together
