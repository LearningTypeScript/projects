# Generics

_Learning TypeScript_'s **Generics** chapter covers making classes, functions, interfaces, and type aliases "generic" by allowing them to work with type parameters:

- Using type parameters to represent different types between uses of a construct
- Providing explicit or implicit type arguments when calling generic functions
- Using generic interfaces to represent generic object types
- Adding type parameters to classes, and how that impacts their types
- Adding type parameters to type aliases, in particular with discriminated type unions
- Modifying generic type parameters with defaults (`=`) and constraints (`extends`)
- How Promises and `async` functions use generics to represent asynchronous data flow
- Best practices with generics, including their Golden Rule and naming conventions
