# Step 2: Clown Availability

The second and -thank heavens- final area of code I'll need you to fix is my clown assignment planner.
I use this to print which clowns will be partying with which guests.

Oh, and they introduced several unsettling clown puns in comments.
It's because of those puns that I can't fix the code myself.

The clowns again changed a few things around, but nothing more than an incorrect type annotation or different value for a variable.

Could you please fix up the file to have no TypeScript complaints?
