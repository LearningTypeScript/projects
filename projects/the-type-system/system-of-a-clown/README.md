# System of a Clown

Those pesky Java programmers are at it again!

I planned an elaborate clown-themed surprise party for my best friend.
The whole event was planned using a few files of TypeScript code I'd written.

My friend somehow caught wind of the party and enlisted the clowns' help to vandalize the program.
Not only did the clowns remove or make incorrect my TypeScript type annotations, they introduced subtle bugs by subtly changing some of the values.

Could you please add correct type annotations in my files and fix any bugs detected by TypeScript?
You're my surprise clown celebration's last hope! ðŸ¤¡

## Setup

Start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:

```shell
tsc --watch
```

## Steps
