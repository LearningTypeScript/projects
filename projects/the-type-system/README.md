# The Type System

_Learning TypeScript_'s **The Type System** chapter covers how TypeScript's type system works at its core:

- What a "type" is and the primitive types recognized by TypeScript
- What a "type system" is and how TypeScript's type system understands code
- How type errors compare to syntax errors
- Inferred variable types and variable assignability
- Type annotations to explicitly declare variable types and avoid evolving `any` types
- Object member checking on type shapes
- ECMAScript module files' declaration scoping compared to script files
