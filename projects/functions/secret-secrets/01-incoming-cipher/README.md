# Step 1: Incoming Cipher

Good.
You've chosen to accept the mission.

Your first task is to implement for us a function we can use to crate text encoders.
As you may recall from Spy 101 training, we often enlist functions such as [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) to hide text from onlookers.

Your assignment, assuming you opt into it, is to develop a `createCipher` function.
Its sole parameter should be a "cipher" function that takes in a string and returns a string.
Its return type should be a function that takes in a string and returns the result of calling that cipher on each character of the string.

> Tip: you can loop over a string a `for...of`

## Specification

Parameters:

1. `cipher`: A function that takes in a string and returns another string

Return: a function with:

- Parameters:
  1. `text`: Any string
- Return type: A string generated by calling `cipher` on every character of `text`
