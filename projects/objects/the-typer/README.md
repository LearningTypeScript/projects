# The Typer

Hmmph.

Last of your kind.
A wandering soul -- not lost, but never found.
Your keen instincts for type safety and sound type systems are a dim light in the dark and dismal world around you.
You are _The Typer_.

An old friend of yours recently gave you a map purporting to include a rare and desirable treasure.
The map is missing TypeScript type annotations, but otherwise seems acceptable.

Can you fill out type annotations to make the map more usable?

## Setup

In your terminal, run the TypeScript compiler via the `tsc` script.
For example, to start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:

```shell
npm run tsc -- --watch
```

## Specification

In `./index.ts`, add TypeScript type annotations to get TypeScript to compile without type errors.

## Notes

- Don't use `any` or leave any implicit `any`s.
- Don't use any arrays or functions, as they haven't been covered in _Learning TypeScript_ yet.
- Don't change any runtime code -- it's fine as-is.
