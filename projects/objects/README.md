_Learning TypeScript_'s **Objects** chapter expands your grasp of the TypeScript type system to be able to work with objects:

- How TypeScript interprets types from object type literals
- Describing object literal types, including nested and optional properties
- Declaring, inferring, and type narrowing with unions of object literal types
- Discriminated unions and discriminants
- Combining object types together with intersection types
