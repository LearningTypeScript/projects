# Step 2: Case Management

Very good, very good.
My birds are classified correctly.
I thank you.

Next, I have a the opposite type of task for you to tackle.
I have created a `Case` type for you and have a `cases` array.
But, the elements in `cases` vary in format and do not always match up with the `Case` type.
Please correct `cases` -- without changing the `Case` type.
