# Step 1: Aviary Classification

As a world-renowned expert in bird law, it is my duty to properly educate the court on the characteristics of various birds and related bird information.
I cannot uphold my critical task if my bird files are not in proper order.

I require you to write an object type describing a `Bird` type for my array of birds.
Please be as specific as possible for types when possible.
Any property other than `name` whose values are strings should be a union of unions of string literals.

## Files

- `index.ts`: Add your object types and type annotations here
- `index.test.ts`: Tests verifying your object types and type annotations
- `solution.ts`: Solution code

## Notes

- Some of the errors presented by TypeScript may use symbols or terms not you haven't covered yet. That's ok! Do your best with what you know so far.
