Hello, fellow lawyer.
I'm glad you've chosen to join me in preparing to engage in legal battle.
As you can see, I require your assistance in developing TypeScript projects to manage my files for this most important case.

## Setup

In your terminal, run the TypeScript compiler via the `tsc` script within whichever step you're working on.
For example, to start the TypeScript compiler on the first step in watch mode:

```shell
npm run tsc -- --project 01-aviary-classification --watch
```

## Steps

- [1. Aviary Classification](./01-aviary-classification)
- [2. Case Management](./02-case-management)
- [3. Making Arguments](./03-making-arguments)

## Notes

- Don't import code from one step into another.
- Use object types (`type`), not interfaces (`interface`)
